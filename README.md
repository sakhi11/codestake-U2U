# CodeStake 🎯

**CodeStake** is a web app that turns learning into a challenge — quite literally! Compete with friends by staking a set amount and racing to complete learning milestones. Whoever hits the milestones first gets rewarded from the staked pool. It’s all about accountability, motivation, and a bit of friendly competition.

## 🚀 Why CodeStake?

- Learning is hard. Staying consistent is harder.
- With CodeStake, you **set learning goals**, **stake real value**, and **compete with a friend** to reach the finish line.
- The more you complete, the more you earn. Fall behind? Well, you snooze, you lose (your stake).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Create a Challenge:** Choose a topic, set milestones, and invite a friend.
2. **Stake an Amount:** Both parties lock in an equal stake.
3. **Track Progress:** Complete milestones and update progress.
4. **Win Rewards:** For every milestone achieved, the system distributes a portion of the stake to the one who reaches it first.

> Example: You and your friend stake ₹1000 each. For every milestone (e.g., completing a React module), the first to complete gets ₹200 from the pool.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Bun
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (Ethereum/Polygon based)
- **Blockchain Tools:** Ethers.js, Hardhat
- **Storage & Backend:** IPFS / Future plans for Supabase
